# Bagster-Hypercasual---Game-Jam

## About the game
This was my first game which i created for a game jam. The topic of the game jam was to create a hypercasual bag runner game. We created this game with a team of 5 people. It is about a bag which becomes a monster bag. The game is divided into three main sections.

### First Cinematic
In this cinematic the owner takes two bags and throws one of them into the thrascan. The bag jumps out of the thrashcan and becomes a monster bag.

### Main Gameplay
The player plays 10 different levels. There are multiple obstacles spreaded out in these levels. The obstacle types are spikes, water puddle, lava puddle, grinder, scissor and monster bags. In some of the levels there are mini bosses at the end of it. The player needs to increase his level to be able to defeat them. In the last level the player confronts the bag which the owner didn't throw in the thrascan.

### End Cinematic
The owner of the bag goes back home with the bag which the player played as.

### Gameplay
The player has a starting level of 1 in every Level. He can eat bags which have a lower level to increase his/her level. If the player collides with obstacles his/her level will be decreased according to the collided obstacle.

### Power ups
There are 2 power ups which the player can buy with in-game points. The first one increases the level of the player. The second one increases the point multiplier.
